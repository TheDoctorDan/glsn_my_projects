License terms
=============

You may freely copy, distribute, and modify these sources.  You may compile,
and run them on any AmigaDOS based computer, and freely distribute the
resulting binaries.

You may not sell either the interpreter library sources or binaries for
profit, other than a disk copying and handling charge.  You may however
include the library within the distribution of a commercial program that
uses it. You may also upload these files to a commercial bulletin board
that charges for connect time, as long as there is no specific charge for
the files.

If you wish to incorporate any part of the interpreter library sources
within a commercial program, or to port the interpreter to another operating
system, you should contact the author to discuss licensing terms.

If you modify the sources the following restrictions apply:

  1) You may not remove the author's copyright notices.

  2) If you change any file you must add a header notice to it outlining
     the changes.

  3) If you release modified versions of the binaries you must change the
     version number to one distinct from the format (V#.# - where "#" is
     any digit) used by the author.  If you change the library you must
     change its version or revision number and ID string.

For queries and bug reports write to the author:

        Adrian Aylward,
        20 Maidstone Road,
        SWINDON,
        Wiltshire.
        UK.

No responsibilities accepted for bugs, but please let me know so I can fix
them.  There is no charge for distributing post.library with commercial
programs, but if you should come up with an interesting application for it
then do feel free to send me a copy.
